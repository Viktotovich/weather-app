# Weather APP through Fetch API

10/10/2024 02:21 Final commit (maybe, gh-pages isnt working)

Welp - it wasn't a final commit.

Project Summary: This project was a way for me to get used to Async Await and promises (asynchronous) Javascript. Fetch was the ideal way to practice since it returns a promise.

This project had quite a few constraints, biggest one being working with WSL instead of a VM.

However, thanks to all the troubles due to Webpack - I was more focused on tackling webpack rather than problems with WSL. Either way, Webpack is a godsent - it is a great addition, and makes everything significantly easier.

Date-fns took 5 mins to implement due to highly modular code, and due to how amazing webpack is. On the other hand, I felt like using template literals to make the modals (as I normally do) - but have read that it exposes genuine sites to attacks (we are immune to it, but it is a good practice to start from now).

Regardless, this project was enjoyable, fun, and taught me quite a lot. I highly reccomend checking out Virtual Crossing API for anyone interested in creating the app of their own.

Oh and, please ignore the design - given more time, I'd be able to come up with something better. This is what happens when you give someone just a day to come up with a design.

If you instead want to see a graphically pleasing, eye-candy - you can instead refer to my restaurant template which you will find here:

In terms of the project itself, it is a success with flying colors!
